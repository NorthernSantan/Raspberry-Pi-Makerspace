					     <h4>Students participating in asynchronous learning</h4>
					    <p>During the current pandemic people are spending more time learning online. Some online classes are run in an asynchronous fashion with work being assigned for days at home. While this process within itself is fine, teachers are still INEXPLICABLY asking students to fill out attendance each morning before class. This means that even though work is assigned for an entire day, students are still required to wake up by a certain time. Our web automation SD cards are set up to allow the user to customize them to automatically fill out virtual attendance each morning. Our modern solution offers students peace of mind, and a good nights sleep, to allow for more productive at home school days.</p>
