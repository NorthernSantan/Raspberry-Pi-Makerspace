# Raspberry-Pi-Makerspace [DEPRICATED]
Raspberry Pi SD cards online store and Online Chemistry resource
I have created my first site and am runnig it on a vps that is linked to this github repository. The website is built primairly to sell pre-formatted sd cards using an HTML and CSS framework.

I have also added an extra projects page written in php that is connected to a mysql database. The page is formatted to allow for user input across a variety of different feilds and will then form search queries and return specific results from my MySQL database.
The idea for this particular project came from the pointless repetition and searching required for online chemistry tests. My project has saved me and my classsmates hours of searching by steamlining the process and outputting data in the nessesary formats.

Check out my website here : https://raspberrypimakerspace.ca/

Next steps for this project : 
  Single search bar for multiple elements or at least streamlining the process; 
  Updating repetitive code in adherence with DRY (don't repeat yourself);

# Note
The app is no longer live due to expensive AWS server charges.
